## Quick Testing Steps

### 1. Load the Extension
1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `dist` folder from this project
5. The Resume Tailor extension should appear in your extensions list

### 2. Test Job Detection
1. Visit one of the supported job sites:
   - [LinkedIn Jobs](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/)
   - [Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/)
   - [Google Jobs](https://jobs.google.com/)
   - [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/)

2. Navigate to any job posting
3. Look for the floating AI button (ðŸ“„) in the bottom right corner
4. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar to see detected job info

### 3. Test Resume Analysis
1. On a job posting page, click the floating AI button (ðŸ“„)
2. In the modal that opens:
   - Either upload a resume file (PDF/DOC)
   - Or paste resume text in the text area
3. Click "Analyze & Tailor Resume"
4. Wait for the analysis results (currently simulated)

### 4. Test Features
- **Match Score**: Should show a percentage (60-100%)
- **Missing Keywords**: Should display highlighted keyword tags
- **Suggestions**: Should show before/after text improvements
- **Copy/Apply**: Test the copy and apply buttons
- **Save Resume**: Test saving functionality

### 5. Test Popup Interface
1. Click the extension icon in Chrome toolbar
2. Switch between "Current Job" and "History" tabs
3. Test refresh functionality
4. Verify job information is displayed correctly

## Expected Behavior

### âœ… Working Features
- Job detection on supported sites
- Floating action button appears
- Extension popup shows detected job
- Analysis modal opens and displays
- Simulated analysis results appear
- UI is responsive and styled with Tailwind

### ðŸ”§ Known Limitations (Expected)
- AI analysis is currently simulated (mock data)
- Icons are placeholder text
- File upload doesn't process actual files yet
- Autofill functionality not implemented

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading
- Check that you selected the `dist` folder, not the root project folder
- Ensure the build completed successfully (`npm run build:extension`)
- Check Chrome DevTools console for errors

### Job Not Detected
- Refresh the page after loading the extension
- Check that you're on a supported job site
- Some sites may load content dynamically - wait a few seconds

### Popup Not Working
- Check Chrome extensions page to ensure permissions are granted
- Try refreshing the job posting page
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors

### Content Script Issues
- Open Chrome DevTools on the job page
- Check Console tab for any error messages
- Verify the extension has permission for the current domain

## Development Testing

### Hot Reload Changes
1. Make code changes
2. Run `npm run build:extension`
3. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Click the refresh icon for Resume Tailor extension
5. Refresh the job posting page to test changes

### Debug Mode
- Open Chrome DevTools while testing
- Check Console for log messages
- Use the Sources tab to debug TypeScript files
- Monitor Network tab for future API calls

## Next Steps for Real Deployment

1. **Add Real Icons**: Create 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 128x128 PNG icons
2. **Integrate AI API**: Replace mock data with real OpenAI/AI service
3. **File Processing**: Implement actual PDF/DOC resume parsing
4. **Error Handling**: Add proper error messages and fallbacks
5. **User Testing**: Get feedback from real users on job sites
